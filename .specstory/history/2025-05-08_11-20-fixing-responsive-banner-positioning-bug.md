# Fixing Responsive Banner Positioning Bug (2025-05-08 20:20:44)

_**User**_

Fix this bug in `sass/base/_header.scss`, `sass/base/_front-page.scss`:
```
The side banners' responsive positioning was broken by replacing the responsive `clamp()` function with a fixed `55px` bottom value. This change:
1. Removes the viewport-width-based responsiveness of the banner positioning
2. Potentially misaligns banners on different screen sizes
3. Unexpectedly displays banners on smartphone screens by removing the previous media query hiding mechanism
```

I'll fix the identified issues with the side banners in the SCSS files:

---

```diff
    position: fixed;
    right: 0;
-   bottom: 55px;
+   bottom: clamp(30px, 3.47vw, 50px); // 50px at 1440px
    z-index: 50;
    display: flex;
```

```diff
    }
    
- 
+   // スマホサイズでは非表示、タブレット以上で表示
+   @include mq(sp) {
+     display: none;
+   }
    
    @include mq(md) {
```

I've fixed the side banners responsive positioning issues in `sass/base/_header.scss` by:

1. Restored the responsive `clamp(30px, 3.47vw, 50px)` function for the bottom position, which ensures proper vertical placement across different viewport widths
2. Added back the missing media query `@include mq(sp) { display: none; }` that hides the banners on smartphone screens
3. Maintained the tablet media query with the row layout

These changes ensure the side banners will:
- Position responsively at different screen sizes 
- Remain hidden on smartphone screens
- Display properly on tablet and desktop screens with appropriate spacing

The responsive positioning now scales properly between 30px and 50px depending on the viewport width, maintaining the original design intention.
